import BOOTSTRAP:

1 CDN that allow you to actually load without downloading the file,a bunch of custom css 
2 {% %} we can override what inside, we can remove it and put another thing in base.html + home.html we move into 
views to render this template home.html that we can see it on the screen by adding render_template on the views page
